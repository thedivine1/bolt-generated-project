            Using an <strong>ideal weight calculator</strong> is a game-changer when it comes to understanding your health and fitness. It helps you determine a healthy weight range based on your height, age, gender, and sometimes even body frame size.
          </p>
        </div>

        <p>
          Understanding what "ideal weight" means is crucial. It's not just about fitting into a certain number on the scale. Instead, it's about finding a weight that supports your overall health and well-being.

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Why Use an Ideal Weight Calculator?</h2>
        <p>An ideal weight calculator helps you gauge where you stand in terms of health. Here are some reasons why it's beneficial:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
          <li><strong>Health Awareness</strong>: Knowing your ideal weight can help you assess potential health risks associated with being underweight or overweight.</li>
          <li><strong>Goal Setting</strong>: It provides a target to aim for in your fitness journey, making it easier to create realistic goals.</li>
          <li><strong>Progress Tracking</strong>: Regularly checking your weight against the ideal range can help you track your progress over time.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">How Does an Ideal Weight Calculator Work?</h2>
        <p>Ideal weight calculators typically use several formulas to estimate a healthy weight range. Some common methods include:</p>
        <div className="bg-secondary/50 p-4 rounded-lg my-4 font-mono text-sm">
          <p className="mb-2"><strong>Devine Formula:</strong></p>
          <p>Men: Ideal Weight = 50 + 2.3 × (height in inches - 60)</p>
          <p>Women: Ideal Weight = 45.5 + 2.3 × (height in inches - 60)</p>
        </div>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">The Importance of Body Composition</h2>
        <p>While the ideal weight calculator gives a good starting point, it's essential to consider body composition as well:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
          <li><strong>Muscle vs Fat</strong>: Muscle weighs more than fat, so someone who is muscular might weigh more but still be healthier.</li>
          <li><strong>Body Fat Percentage</strong>: Understanding body fat percentage can provide deeper insights into your health than weight alone.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Tips for Achieving Your Ideal Weight</h2>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
          <li><strong>Balanced Diet</strong>: Focus on whole foods—fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and healthy fats.</li>
          <li><strong>Regular Exercise</strong>: Incorporate both cardio and strength training into your routine.</li>
          <li><strong>Stay Hydrated</strong>: Drinking enough water is vital for metabolism and helps control hunger.</li>
          <li><strong>Monitor Progress</strong>: Keep track of your weight and body measurements regularly.</li>
        </ul>
